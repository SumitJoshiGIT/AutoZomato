## How it works:

1. **Data Collection**: During processing, detailed review information is stored in `processedReviewsLog`
2. **Data Transmission**: When a tab completes, the detailed log is sent to the background script
3. **Data Enrichment**: Background script adds URL, timestamp, and restaurant name to each entry
4. **Excel Export**: User clicks "Download Excel Report" to generate and download CSV file
5. **CSV Format**: Data is properly escaped and formatted for Excel compatibility

## Excel File Contents:

The downloaded CSV file contains:
- **Restaurant Name**: Extracted from URL or marked as "Unknown Restaurant"
- **Customer Name**: Full customer name from review
- **Extracted Name**: First name used in personalized replies
- **Review ID**: Unique identifier for the review
- **Review Text**: Complete review content
- **Rating**: Star rating given by the customer (1-5 stars)
- **Complaint ID**: AI-detected complaint category ID or "None"
- **Generated Reply**: AI-generated response
- **Replied Status**: Whether the reply was actually published
- **Included in Auto-Reply**: Whether user selected this review for auto-reply
- **URL**: Source URL of the review
- **Timestamp**: When the review was processed

## Benefits:

- **Comprehensive Data**: All review details, replies, processing status, ratings, and AI analysis in one file
- **Excel Compatible**: Direct import into Excel for analysis and reporting
- **Business Intelligence**: Rating analysis and complaint categorization for insights
- **Audit Trail**: Complete record of what was processed and replied to
- **Selection Tracking**: Shows which reviews were included/excluded by user choice
- **AI Analysis Tracking**: Shows detected complaint categories and rating patterns
- **Easy Analysis**: Structured data format for business intelligence and reporting
- **Proper Formatting**: CSV escaping handles special characters and multiline content

This implementation provides a complete audit trail and reporting capability for the AutoZomato extension, making it suitable for business use where documentation and analysis of review responses is important.
