# AI Request Segregation - Name Extraction & Review Analysis

## Overview

The AI analysis has been separated into two distinct, focused requests to improve accuracy and reliability:

1. **Name Extraction Request** - Dedicated to extracting customer first names
2. **Review Analysis Request** - Focused on sentiment analysis and complaint detection

## Changes Made

### 1. First AI Request - Name Extraction
- **Purpose**: Extract customer first name from username/display name
- **Input**: Customer name only
- **Output**: `{ firstName: string|null, confidence: number }`
- **Token Limit**: 50 tokens (reduced from 150)
- **Temperature**: 0.1 (low for consistency)

#### Benefits:
- Focused task leads to better name extraction accuracy
- Reduced token usage for name extraction
- Cleaner separation of concerns
- Less prone to hallucination with focused prompt

### 2. Second AI Request - Review Analysis
- **Purpose**: Analyze review content for sentiment and complaints
- **Input**: Review text, rating, and complaint categories
- **Output**: `{ sentiment: string, complaintId: string|null }`
- **Token Limit**: 100 tokens (reduced from 150)
- **Temperature**: 0.1 (low for consistency)

#### Benefits:
- More focused on review content analysis
- Better complaint detection without name extraction interference
- Cleaner sentiment analysis
- Reduced token usage overall

### 3. Fallback Handling
- **Name Extraction Fallback**: Uses `smartExtractFirstName()` function
- **Review Analysis Fallback**: Uses `fallbackAnalysis()` function
- **Independent Failures**: Each request can fail independently without affecting the other

### 4. Error Handling
- Each AI request has independent error handling
- If name extraction fails, review analysis continues
- If review analysis fails, name extraction results are preserved
- Combined results are validated after both requests

## Implementation Details

### Request Flow:
1. **Name Extraction Request** → Extract firstName + confidence
2. **Review Analysis Request** → Extract sentiment + complaintId
3. **Combine Results** → Create unified classification object
4. **Validation** → Apply existing validation logic
5. **Response Generation** → Use combined results for reply

### Variable Structure:
```javascript
let classification = {
    sentiment: string,      // From review analysis
    complaintId: string,    // From review analysis  
    firstName: string,      // From name extraction
    confidence: number      // From name extraction
};
```

### Performance Impact:
- **Requests**: 2 sequential AI requests instead of 1
- **Tokens**: Reduced total token usage (~150 tokens total vs 150+ per request)
- **Accuracy**: Improved due to focused tasks
- **Reliability**: Better error handling and fallback options

## Expected Improvements

1. **Better Name Extraction**: Focused prompt should extract names more accurately
2. **Improved Complaint Detection**: Review analysis won't be distracted by name extraction
3. **Reduced Hallucination**: Smaller, focused prompts are less prone to hallucination
4. **Better Error Recovery**: Independent failures allow partial success
5. **Easier Debugging**: Can debug name extraction and review analysis separately

## Backward Compatibility

- All existing functionality preserved
- Same validation logic applied
- Same output format and logging
- Same fallback mechanisms
- Same UI and user experience

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test name extraction accuracy with various username formats
2. Test complaint detection with different review types
3. Test fallback behavior when individual requests fail
4. Monitor token usage and performance
5. Verify validation logic still works correctly
