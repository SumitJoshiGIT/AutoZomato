# AutoZomato Name Hallucination Fix

## Issue Description
The AI was hallucinating and producing "Aaron" as a first name most of the time instead of properly extracting actual names from customer usernames. This was causing inappropriate personalization with wrong names.

## Root Cause
1. **Prompt Examples**: The AI was learning from the "aaron6689" → "Aaron" example too heavily
2. **High Temperature**: Temperature of 0.7 was allowing too much creativity
3. **Lack of Validation**: No validation to ensure extracted names actually exist in the original customer name
4. **Generic Fallback Logic**: The manual extraction logic was also too permissive

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced AI Prompt (content.js)
**Before:**
```
3. "firstName": String - Extract a valid first name or identifier from the username...
   - "aaron6689" → "Aaron" ✓ 
```

**After:**
```
3. "firstName": String - ONLY extract a real name from the ACTUAL customer name provided. DO NOT make up names. Rules:
   - NEVER invent names - only extract what's actually there
CRITICAL: Only extract names that actually exist in the customer name. Do not hallucinate or guess names.
```

### 2. Reduced AI Temperature
**Before:** `temperature: 0.7` (high creativity)
**After:** `temperature: 0.1` (low creativity, more deterministic)

### 3. Added Name Validation Logic
```javascript
// Additional validation: Check if AI hallucinated a name that's not in the original customer name
if (classification.firstName && classification.firstName.length > 0) {
    const customerNameLower = (review.customerName || '').toLowerCase();
    const extractedNameLower = classification.firstName.toLowerCase();
    
    // Check if the extracted name is actually present in the customer name
    if (!customerNameLower.includes(extractedNameLower)) {
        console.warn(`[AutoZomato] AI hallucinated name "${classification.firstName}" not found in "${review.customerName}". Removing.`);
        classification.firstName = null;
        classification.confidence = 0;
    }
}
```

### 4. Improved Manual Extraction (smartExtractFirstName)
**Enhanced Logic:**
- First checks for space-separated real names (high confidence: 0.9)
- Then checks standalone valid names (medium confidence: 0.6)
- Finally extracts from usernames (good confidence: 0.7)
- Added expanded generic word filtering
- Stricter length and character requirements

### 5. Updated Example Response
**Before:** Shows "Aaron" example that AI was copying
**After:** Shows null response to discourage hallucination
```json
{
  "complaintId": "1",
  "sentiment": "Negative", 
  "firstName": null,
  "confidence": 0.0
}
```

### 6. Customer-Specific Context
Added specific customer name to prompt:
```
IMPORTANT: You are analyzing this specific customer - "${review.customerName}". Only extract names that are actually present in this exact customer name. Do not use "Aaron" or any other example names.
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### ✅ Correct Extraction Examples:
- "Rahul Kumar" → "Rahul" (confidence: 0.9)
- "john123" → "John" (confidence: 0.7)
- "Zak" → "Zak" (confidence: 0.6)

### ✅ Correct Rejection Examples:
- "FD" → null (too short)
- "User123" → null (generic)
- "6689" → null (numbers only)
- "FoodLover" → null (generic word)

### ✅ No More Hallucination:
- Random customer names will no longer produce "Aaron"
- AI will return null instead of guessing names
- Validation will catch any remaining hallucinations

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with various customer name formats
2. Monitor logs for hallucination warnings
3. Verify confidence scores are appropriate
4. Check that null names result in neutral greetings

## Files Modified
- `/src/content/content.js` - Enhanced prompt, validation, and extraction logic
- Added this documentation file

The system should now be much more accurate and conservative about name extraction, preventing inappropriate personalization with hallucinated names.
