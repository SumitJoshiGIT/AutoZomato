# AutoZomato Checkbox Feature Implementation

## What was added:

### 1. Review Selection Checkboxes
- Added a new "Include" column to the log popup table
- Each review now has a checkbox that allows users to include/exclude it from auto-reply
- Checkboxes are checked by default (`includeInAutoReply: true`)
- Checkboxes are disabled for reviews that have already been replied to

### 2. Enhanced Log Popup Header
- Shows total number of reviews processed
- Shows count of reviews selected for reply
- Shows count of reviews already replied to
- Format: "AutoZomato Reply Log (X reviews) - Y selected for reply, Z already replied"

### 3. Smart Reply to All Button
- Dynamically shows how many reviews will be processed: "Reply to All (X)"
- Button is disabled when no reviews are selected
- Button becomes semi-transparent when disabled

### 4. Select All / Deselect All Button
- New button that allows users to quickly select or deselect all unreplied reviews
- Button text and color changes based on current state:
  - "Select All" (green) when some reviews are unselected
  - "Deselect All" (red) when all reviews are selected
- Button is hidden when all reviews have been replied to

### 5. Updated Processing Logic
- `handleReplyToAll()` now only processes reviews where `includeInAutoReply: true`
- Skips reviews that are unchecked
- Logs the number of selected reviews before processing

## How it works:

1. **Initial Processing**: When the extension scrapes reviews, all reviews are set to `includeInAutoReply: true` by default
2. **User Selection**: Users can click on checkboxes to exclude specific reviews from auto-reply
3. **Smart UI Updates**: The header and buttons update in real-time to reflect the current selection
4. **Filtered Processing**: Only checked reviews are processed when "Reply to All" is clicked

## User Experience:

- Users can see at a glance how many reviews are ready for reply
- Easy bulk selection/deselection with the "Select All" button
- Clear visual feedback about what will be processed
- Disabled checkboxes for already-replied reviews prevent accidental changes
- Editable replies are preserved when checkbox state changes

## Technical Implementation:

- Added `includeInAutoReply` boolean property to each log entry
- Created `handleIncludeCheckboxChange()` function to handle checkbox state changes
- Enhanced `updateLogPopupHeader()` to provide real-time statistics
- Added `handleSelectAll()` function for bulk selection management
- Modified `handleReplyToAll()` to filter by checkbox state
- Added proper event listeners and DOM manipulation for dynamic updates

This implementation gives users full control over which reviews get auto-replied while maintaining a clean and intuitive interface.
