# Completion Alert Feature

## Overview
The AutoZomato extension now displays alerts when all queries are processed, indicating whether the page is "resolved" (all reviews replied) or has "unanswered" reviews.

## Features

### 1. Processing Completion Alert
- **Triggers**: After all reviews have been processed
- **Types of alerts**:
  - ✅ **RESOLVED**: All reviews have been replied to successfully
  - ⚠️ **UNANSWERED**: Some reviews still need replies
  - ℹ️ **NO REVIEWS**: No reviews found in the selected date range

### 2. Alert Methods
- **Browser Alert**: Standard JavaScript alert dialog
- **Browser Notification**: Native browser notification (if permission granted)
- **Log Entry**: Status message added to the popup log

### 3. Notification Permission
- Automatically requests notification permission when popup loads
- Gracefully handles cases where notifications are not supported
- Uses extension icon for notification display

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
- `src/popup/popup.js`: Added `showCompletionAlert()` and `requestNotificationPermission()` methods
- `manifest.json`: Added "notifications" permission

### Code Flow
1. After processing completion, `handleProcessingComplete()` calls `showCompletionAlert()`
2. `showCompletionAlert()` analyzes results and determines page status
3. Shows browser alert with appropriate message
4. Attempts to show browser notification if permission granted
5. Logs completion status in popup log

### Message Format
- **Alert Title**: Page Status indicator
- **Alert Body**: Summary of reviews processed vs. replied
- **Log Message**: Color-coded status message

## Usage
1. Start processing reviews in the extension
2. Wait for all reviews to be processed
3. Alert will automatically appear showing page status
4. Check popup log for detailed status information

## Benefits
- Immediate feedback on processing completion
- Clear indication of page resolution status
- Multiple notification methods for better visibility
- Persistent log for reference
