# Complaint Detection and Rating Adjustment Fixes

## Changes Made

### 1. Rating Adjustment Logic
- **Issue**: The rating adjustment logic was already correct but user requested confirmation
- **Current Logic**: If rating >= 4 AND sentiment is "Negative", reduce rating by 1
- **Status**: âœ… Working correctly

### 2. Complaint Detection Improvements
- **Issue**: AI model was not detecting complaints at all due to overly strict validation
- **Changes Made**:

#### AI Prompt Enhancements:
- Made complaint detection more permissive and aggressive
- Added specific examples of complaint indicators: "could be better", "not bad but...", "okay but...", "average", "disappointed", "expected more"
- Changed from "CLEARLY describes a specific problem" to "ANY dissatisfaction or problem"
- Added rating-based guidance:
  - 1-2 stars: Assume there's likely a complaint even if not explicitly stated
  - 3 stars: Look for any dissatisfaction or neutral/negative tone
  - 4+ stars: Only detect complaints if specific issues are mentioned

#### Validation Logic Relaxed:
- **Text Length Check**: Reduced from 5 characters to 3 characters minimum
- **5-Star Review Check**: Changed from blocking all complaints to only blocking when explicitly positive language is present
- **Negative Keywords**: Expanded list to include: bland, tasteless, overpriced, small portions, long wait, unfriendly, unprofessional

#### Specific Changes:
1. **AI Prompt**: Made complaint detection more sensitive to dissatisfaction
2. **Validation**: Only remove complaints for 5-star reviews with explicitly positive words like "excellent", "amazing", "great", "perfect", etc.
3. **Keywords**: Added more comprehensive negative indicators

## Expected Results
- AI should now detect more legitimate complaints
- Rating adjustment continues to work for 4+ star reviews with negative sentiment
- Validation is less likely to remove valid complaints
- System should be more balanced between detecting complaints and preventing false positives

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with 3-star reviews containing subtle dissatisfaction
2. Test with 4-star reviews that mention specific issues
3. Test with 1-2 star reviews to ensure complaints are detected
4. Verify that 5-star reviews with clearly positive language don't get complaint IDs
