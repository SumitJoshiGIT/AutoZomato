# Persistent Results Download Feature

## Problem Fixed:
The download option for processing results was only available while the popup remained open during processing. If users closed and reopened the popup after processing completed, the results section would be hidden and the download option would disappear.

## Solution Implemented:

### 1. **Persistent Results Storage**
- Modified `saveData()` to save `lastResults` and `lastResultsTimestamp` to chrome.storage.local
- Results are now preserved even when the popup is closed and reopened

### 2. **Results Restoration on Startup**
- Updated `loadSavedData()` to restore previous results if available
- Added `showPreviousResults()` method to display saved results when popup reopens
- Results are automatically shown if not currently processing

### 3. **Clear Visual Indication**
- Added timestamp display to show when results were generated
- Different behavior for fresh results vs. previous results:
  - **Fresh results**: No timestamp shown (just completed)
  - **Previous results**: Shows "Results from: [date/time]" 

### 4. **Smart UI Management**
- Results section is hidden during new processing
- Previous results are shown when popup reopens (if available)
- Download button remains functional for any saved results
- Timestamp is cleared when starting new processing

### 5. **User Experience Improvements**
- Clear log message indicates when previous results are available
- Users can always download the latest results, regardless of popup state
- No confusion between fresh and previous results

## How it works:

1. **During Processing**: Results are tracked and saved when processing completes
2. **Popup Closed**: Results remain saved in chrome.storage.local
3. **Popup Reopened**: Previous results are automatically restored and displayed
4. **Download Always Available**: Users can download results anytime, even after reopening popup
5. **New Processing**: Previous results are cleared when starting new processing

## Benefits:

- ✅ **Persistent Access**: Download option available even after closing popup
- ✅ **Clear Timestamps**: Users know when results were generated
- ✅ **No Data Loss**: Results are never lost due to popup closure
- ✅ **Intuitive UX**: Previous results clearly marked with timestamps
- ✅ **Always Functional**: Download button works regardless of popup state

This fix ensures that users can always access and download their processing results, making the extension much more reliable for business use where users might need to access results later.
