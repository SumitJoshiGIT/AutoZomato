# URL Group Management Feature

## Overview
The AutoZomato extension now includes a comprehensive URL group management system that allows users to organize restaurant URLs into named groups for better organization and selective processing.

## Key Features

### 1. Group Creation and Management
- **Create Groups**: Click the "+ Group" button to create a new group
- **Edit Groups**: Click the edit icon (‚úèÔ∏è) next to any group to rename it
- **Delete Groups**: Click the delete icon (üóëÔ∏è) to remove a group (URLs are moved back to the main list)
- **Group Selection**: Click on a group name to view and manage its URLs

### 2. URL Organization
- **Add to Groups**: Select a group from the dropdown next to any URL in the main list
- **Remove from Groups**: When viewing a group, use the √ó button to remove URLs from that group
- **Automatic Management**: URLs are automatically moved between the main list and groups

### 3. Selective Processing
- **Checkbox Selection**: Each URL now has a checkbox for individual selection
- **Select All/Deselect All**: Bulk selection controls for convenience
